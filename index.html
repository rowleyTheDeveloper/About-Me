				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I am 27 years old and really love to learn new things. I studied Economics and minored in Finance in college and jumped right into the industry when I graduated school. After about 4 years in the business my thirst for knowledge continued to grow and I found myself more and more interested in the tech field. During the Covid-19 pandemic I was given a lot of time to think what my next move was going to be and becoming a developer seemed like the perfect decision. Finally, after months of speculation I decided to attend the coding bootcamp Thinkful and I could not be happier.
        </p>
        <p>When I am not working or studying, I love to be outdoors. Hiking, running, snowboarding and going on long walks with my dog are what I find most relaxing. I also love exploring NYC as I can always seem to find myself falling in love with a different part of the city every few months.</p>
        <p>If you are looking to hire a new professional in this business please take a look at my portfolio and contact information. I love to learn and couldn’t be more excited to start this new journey! </p>
